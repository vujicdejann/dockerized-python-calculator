1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vujicdejann/dockerized-python-calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd dockerized-python-calculator
   ```

## Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image for the calculator, run the following command in the project's root directory:
